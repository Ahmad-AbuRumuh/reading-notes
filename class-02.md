To describe the structure of a page, HTML elements are utilized (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
Additionally, they supply semantic data (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

* HEADINGS

There are six "levels" of headers in HTML.

* PARAGRAPHS

To make a paragraph, use an initial ptag and a closing /p tag to enclose the words that make up the paragraph.

* BOLD & ITALIC

We may make characters appear bold by surrounding words in the tags b> and /b>.

Also we can make characters appear italic by surrounding words in the tags I and /i>.

CSS allows you to set rules that specify how an element's content should be displayed. For example, you can specify that the page's background be cream, that all paragraphs be gray and typeset in Arial, and that all level one heads be in a blue, italic Times typeface.

A script consists of a set of statements. Each statement functions similarly to a step in a recipe.
The directions in scripts are fairly specific. You may, for example, require that a value be remembered before doing a calculation with it.
Variables are used to store data that is used in the script on a temporary basis.
Arrays are an unique type of variable that can hold several pieces of connected data.
