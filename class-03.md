# HTML & CSS

## Lists

There are three types of lists in HTML:

1- ordered list

It's used to number the list.

2- unordered list

It uses the bullets in the list.

3- definition list

it's used to define terminology.

## Boxes

Each HTML element is treated as though it were its own box in CSS. also it can be used to control the size of a box.

CSS can also be used to manage the borders, margins, and padding for each box.

# JS

## Arrays

Arrays are an unique type of variable that can hold several pieces of connected data.

The values in an array are accessible in the same way as they would be in a numbered list. It's vital to note that this list's numbering begins at zero (not one).

## Conditional statements

Conditional statements allow your program to decide what to do next.

* If else

If ... else statements will let you run one set of code if a situation is true, and every other if it's miles false.

* switch

You can use switch statements to compare a value to various results (and also provides a default option if none match).

* loops

For, while, and do... while are the three types of loops. Each of them repeats the same set of statements.
