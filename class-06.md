## What is an object

Objects bring together a collection of variables and functions to construct a model of what you'd see in real life. Variables and functions in an object are given new names.

IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES and FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS.

## Document Object Model

A DOM tree is used by the browser to represent the page.

DOM trees have four types of nodes:

* document nodes
* element nodes
* attribute nodes
* text nodes

You can use CSS selector syntax to select element nodes based on their id or class attributes, tag name, or CSS selector syntax.
