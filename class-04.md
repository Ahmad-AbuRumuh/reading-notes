# HTML & CSS

## Links

They allow you to go from one online page to another, links are the distinguishing feature of the internet.

The href attribute of the a> element is used to specify the page to which you are linking.
If you're connecting to a page on your own website, relative links are preferable to qualified URLs.

## Layouts

A div> (or other block-level) element is commonly used to group a lot of items together. For example, you could put together all of the parts that make up a website's header (such as the logo and the main navigation). The containing element is defined as the div> element that contains this collection of elements.

Normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning are the three CSS positioning strategies that allow you to control the layout of a page. The position property in CSS is used to indicate the positioning system. The float property can also be used to float items.

Variables are known as the object's properties, whereas functions are known as the object's methods.
