# HTML & CSS

## Images

CSS can be used to specify picture dimensions. Â When you use the same image size on multiple pages of your site, this is quite useful.

A backdrop picture can be used behind any element on a website that creates a box.

CSS can be used to align images both horizontally and vertically.

```JavaScript
body {  
    background-image: url("images/tulip.gif");      background-repeat: no-repeat;  background-position: 50% 50%;}
```

## Practical Information

Search engine optimization (SEO) aids in the discovery of your website by people utilizing search engines.

Google Analytics, for example, allows you to know how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do after they there.

To publish your website on the internet, you'll need a domain name and web hosting.
