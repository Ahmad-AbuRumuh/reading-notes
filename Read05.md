### loops

A loop is a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to go X steps in one direction and then Y steps in the opposite way.
Loops come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but they all perform the same thing: they repeat an activity a certain number of times.

**There are many types of loop but we will talk about the most used, which are:**

* For statement

A for loop is a conditional expression that repeats until it evaluates to false. JavaScript's loop is similar to Java's and C's loops.

Ex of **for** statement:

"for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])"

* While statement

While statements are executed as long as a specific condition evaluates to true.

Ex of **while** statement:

"while (condition)"
