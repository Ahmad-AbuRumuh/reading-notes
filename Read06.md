# What is CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language for describing the appearance of a document authored in a markup language like HTML.

## For what we use it
**A document** is typically a text file formatted using a markup language â€“ the most prevalent markup language is HTML, although other markup languages such as SVG or XML may also be used.

**Presenting** a document to a user entails transforming it into a format that your audience can understand. Browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, and Edge are designed to graphically present content on a computer screen, projector, or printer.
