## Error Handling & Debugging

Debugging is the process of identifying and correcting mistakes. It entails a deductive approach.

The console aids in narrowing down the error's location so that you can try to pinpoint the specific error.

If you anticipate an error, use the try, catch, and finally statements to gracefully handle it. Use these to provide useful feedback to your users.

``` JavaScript
try { 
    // Try to execute this code
} catch (exception) { 
    // If there is an exception, run this code
} finally  {
    // This always  gets executed
}
```
