# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

Our data-driven era allows us to scrutinize our work habits and office eccentricities in ways that our cubicle-bound forefathers could only imagine. Psychologists, sociologists, and statisticians are researching everything from team composition to email trends on corporate campuses and in university laboratories today in attempt to figure out how to make employees faster, better, and more productive versions of themselves. "We're in the midst of a golden age of personal production," says Marshall Van Alstyne, a Boston University professor who studies how individuals share knowledge. ‘‘All of a sudden, we can dissect the minute decisions that we all make, decisions that most of us don't even notice, and figure out why certain people are so much more effective than others."

Google, one of the most outspoken proponents of how studying workers may boost productivity, became obsessed with assembling the ideal team five years ago. The internet behemoth has spent tens of millions of dollars tracking practically every aspect of its employees' life over the previous decade. Google's People Operations team has looked into everything from how often different people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build broader networks by rotating lunch partners) to the characteristics the best managers have in common (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).
