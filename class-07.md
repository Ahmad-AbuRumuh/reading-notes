# HTML & CSS

## Tables

The table> element is used to add tables to a web page.

You indicate the start of each row using the opening tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.)

Each cell of a table is represented using a td>element. (The td stands for table data.)

``` HTML
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## JS

## objects

An object in JavaScript is a separate entity having properties and a type. Consider the example of a cup. A cup is a property-rich object. A cup has a color, a pattern, a weight, and a material made of it, among other things. JavaScript objects, likewise, can have properties that determine their qualities.

Occasionally, you'll want numerous objects to represent the same thing. Object constructors can utilize a function to create objects as a template.

``` JavaScript
var hotel = { name : 'Park', rooms : 120, booked : 77. } ; 
```
