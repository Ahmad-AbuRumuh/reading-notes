# HTML & CSS

## Tables

The table> element is used to add tables to a web page.

You indicate the start of each row using the opening tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.)

Each cell of a table is represented using a td>element. (The td stands for table data.)

## objects

Objects bring together a collection of variables and functions to construct a model of what you'd see in real life. Variables and functions in an object are given new names.

``` JavaScript
var hotel = { name : 'Park', rooms : 120, booked : 77. } ; 
```

Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
