# HTML & CSS

## Tables

The table> element is used to add tables to a web page.

You indicate the start of each row using the opening tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.)

Each cell of a table is represented using a td>element. (The td stands for table data.)

``` HTML
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## What is an object

Objects bring together a collection of variables and functions to construct a model of what you'd see in real life. Variables and functions in an object are given new names.

IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES and FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS.
