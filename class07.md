# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

**1- Who is Roy Fielding?**

He contributed to the development of the first web servers, which delivered content across the internet... Then he spent a lot of time researching why the web works the way it does. His name appears in the protocol specification for getting pages from servers to your browser.

**2- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

Because they weren't meant to be utilized in that manner. When Fielding and his colleagues started constructing the web, being able to communicate with any machine on the planet was a top priority. However, most of the following ways for getting computers to communicate with one another did not meet those prerequisites. You only had to communicate with a limited number of machines.

**3- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

The first section instructs the browser on the protocol to utilize. That information you write in there is one of the most significant advances in computing history.

**4- What does a GET do?**

The GET method is used to obtain data from a specific resource.

**5- What does a POST do?**

POST is a protocol for sending data to a server in order to create or update a resource.

**6- What does PUT do?**

PUT is a protocol for sending data to a server in order to create or update a resource.

**7- What does PATCH do?**

request method applies partial modifications to a resource.
