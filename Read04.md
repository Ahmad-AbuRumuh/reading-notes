# What is JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a first-class compiled programming language that is lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled. While JavaScript is best known as a scripting language for Web pages, it is also used in a variety of non-browser settings, including Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a single-threaded, prototype-based, dynamic language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) programming styles.
