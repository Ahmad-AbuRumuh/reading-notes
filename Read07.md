# Expressions

Any valid unit of code that resolves to a value is called an expression.

* The following expression categories are in JavaScript:

1. Arithmetic: represents the numbers
2. String: represents the character string
3. Logical: represents true or false
4. Primary expression: basic keywords
5. Left-hand-side: Left values are the destination of an assignment

# Functions

In JavaScript, functions are one of the most basic building components. In JavaScript, a function is comparable to a procedure—a series of instructions that performs a task or calculates a value—but a process must accept some input and return an output with some evident relationship between the input and the output to qualify as a function. You must define a function someplace in the scope from which you want to call it before you may use it.

* Example of the function code
> function name(number){
  return;
  }
