# HTML & CSS

## Layouts

A div> (or other block-level) element is commonly used to group a lot of items together. For example, you could put together all of the parts that make up a website's header (such as the logo and the main navigation). The containing element is defined as the div> element that contains this collection of elements.

Normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning are the three CSS positioning strategies that allow you to control the layout of a page. The position property in CSS is used to indicate the positioning system. The float property can also be used to float items.

Example:

``` HTML
<body>
  <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>  
  <div>
    <p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking  machine that would help him get around the  royal gardens faster...
    </p>  
  </div>
</body>
```
