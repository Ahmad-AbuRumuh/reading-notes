# <div align="center"> What is markdown
  
Markdown is a web-based text formatting system. You have complete control over how the document appears; bolding or italicizing phrases, inserting photos, and generating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Markdown is mostly simply plain text with a few non-alphabetic characters like # or * thrown in for good measure.
